## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue or vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, email us privately at: [vision.team@email.com](mailto:vision.team@email.com)

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit secrets (passwords, API keys, tokens).
- Always use HTTPS for remote URLs.
- Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit`.

## Disclosure Policy

We respond to security reports within **48 hours**. Valid issues will be fixed ASAP with a proper changelog entry and patch release.

Thanks for keeping our project secure!
